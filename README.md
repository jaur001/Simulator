# Simulator Desktop App
This project was the my final project and part of a Big data project developed by 4 Junior Java developers and a Senior developer that guided us. It the desktop App that simulate a virtual economic environment formed by companies that buy and sell products and service. These companies act in function of certain parameters and strategies to get the highest benefits and maintaining the rules and laws in the reality (e.g. Minimum salaries for the employers). All these Economy of Market works based of demands.

During the execution the simulator will generate a high volume of invoices or bills that can be analyzed by other programs or processed by Big data applications, like in the case of this project. The rest of the modules of the main project use these invoices to generate reports about taxes automatically or to calculate the financial state of the companies. The bills will be saved in XMLFiles folder.

The Dekstop app is focused on the main objective, generate a high volume of invoices. There is no user interface and the important data is displayed in the console, so it is used to get easily bills and used for other purporses or for testing.

This project was focused on the Backend (more than 250 classes) side to get the most reliability and realistic Virtual Economic Simulation and to be scalable using the base Arquitecture developed.
